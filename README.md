# Networth Tracker
 
This project is created to keep track of user's net worth from their stock account from various exchanges.
Currently, I only found three libraries that I can use to pull data from three different exchange: 
 * Robinhood
 * TD Ameritrade
 * Gemini 

First task of the project is to work on the data i got from robinhood and try to draw a pie to represent the percentage of each stock that the user is holding.
